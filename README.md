## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Hamza**, a Data Scientist who loves turning data into insights that help people make smarter decisions.  
I enjoy exploring patterns in data, building interactive dashboards, and using machine learning to solve real-world problems.  

During my studies, Iâ€™ve worked on projects involving data forecasting, predictive modeling, and natural language processing, including tasks such as analyzing consumption patterns and performing sentiment analysis on text data.
